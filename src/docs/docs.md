# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 What is Pinel?

Pinel is a code-editor written using the Rust programming language as well as the popular [Iced Library](https://iced.rs/) for GUI rendering.
Pinel aims to bridge some gaps between Visual Studio Code as well as editors like Neovim and Helix by being really fast and extremely customizable.

## 1.2 Why use it / key concepts

If you've ever found:
- VSCode (Visual Studio Code) too slow or too much of a gimmick
- Neovim/Vim a bit too complicated (too high of a learning curve)

And if you wanted an editor that just gets things done without throwing everything at you, Pinel might be a good choice. It is in no means a fully fledged editor that I recommend you switch over to, but it is in a decently okay state that you could use for testing and such.

Here are some of the features that are currently working in Pinel:
- Integrated terminal support
    - If you use MacOS, your `zsh` terminal works perfectly fine in Pinel using the `iced-term` package for Rust
    - Not tested for Windows but will be tested and fixed in the next `@stable` release for Pinel. (keep an eye out on Crates and Github Releases)
- LSP (Language Server Protocol) support
    - Out-of-the-box LSP support for Rust (rust-analzyer), Python (), Go, C/C++, and more!
    - Supports Autocomplete, and Hover Documentation
    - De-loads LSP for inactive files (especially useful for rust-analyzer due to memory intensity)
- Custom theming
    - By using Lua you are able to theme your code-editor to your liking
    - Soon to have internal API that can be called using Lua for scripting
- Wakatime support
    - Enjoy tracking time? Or part of Hack Club?
    - Set your own Wakatime URL and API key to send heartbeats to any server of your choice
    - Uses wakatime-cli

## 1.3 Architecture

Pinel uses [Iced](https://iced.rs) for the GUI rendering due to its support for ligatures (allows uses to use nerd fonts), [iced-code-editor](https://github.com/LuDog71FR/iced-code-editor) for core features such as LSP support and line numbers, [iced-term](https://github.com/Harzu/iced_term) for integrated terminal support as well as many other packages and their functions mentioned under the [CREDITS.md](https://github.com/kashsuks/Pinel/blob/master/CREDITS.md) file for Pinel. Go check them out!

# 2. Getting Started

Pinel currently has active support for the following:
- Mac Silicon (M1, M2, M3, etc)
- Windows (Windows 10 and Windows 11)
- Arch Linux
- [Rust Package Manager Crates.io](https://crates.io)
- [Arch Linux User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/)

There is planned support in the future for the following:
- Other Linux distros
- Homebrew (MacOS)
- Winget/Chocolatey

## 2.1 macOS

Lucky for you, I develop on MacOS therefore every version (Stable, Dev, Alpha, etc) is guaranteed to have every feature on MacOS. There have been plans to have the ability to use a .DMG file for users to easily install however that requires `Gatekeeper` access for Mac meaning I would need a developer account. 

That aside, here is how you can install of MacOS.

You can use the following command and paste it in your terminal:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://pinel.netlify.app/install.sh | sh
```
And the script will install the editor for usage!

You can also install via the `pinel-macos-x86_64` under the latest release which can be found [here](https://github.com/kashsuks/Pinel/releases)

Due to the extra security that MacOS has for unverified apps, you will need to grant the app some permissions (that Gatekeeper would otherwise give by default). Here are the steps to follow:
- Copy the path of your installation
- Go to your terminal of choice and type in `chmod +x <the path to the install>`
- Then run `./pinel-macos-x86_64`

*Optional*: You can also add this new binary to your `$PATH` if you would like to just refer to the app as `Pinel`

**For users looking for a Homebrew installation, hang tight it will be available soon**

## 2.2 Windows

Due to the simplicity that Windows (10/11) provides with installing external apps, you're in luck! All you need to do is:

Go to the Github Releases page found [here](https://github.com/kashsuks/Pinel/releases)

Download the `rode-editor-windows-x86_64.exe` file as this is for Windows systems.

From here you can just double-click the install file to open up the app!

*Optional*: You can also add this new binary to your `$PATH` if you would like to just refer to the app as `Pinel`

**There is no active option for Winget or Chocolatey however they are in the works.**

## 2.3 Linux

Describe how to install and run Pinel on Linux distributions.

You might include:

- Generic tarball/ AppImage instructions.
- Distro‑specific notes (Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc.).

```bash
# Example (replace with real commands)
curl -L https://example.com/pinel.tar.gz -o pinel.tar.gz
tar xzf pinel.tar.gz
./pinel
```

## 2.4 Package managers

Pinel currently has support through the following package managers:

- [Crates.io](https://crates.io/)
```bash
cargo install pinel
```

- [AUR (Arch User Repository)](https://aur.archlinux.org/)
Using an AUR helper like `yay`:

```bash
yay -S pinel
```

or with `paru`:

```bash
paru -S pinel
```
